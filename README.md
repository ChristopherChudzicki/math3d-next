# Math3d-next

[Math3d](https://math3d.org) is a web-based, 3d math visualization toolâ€”an online 3d graphing calculator.

The repository represents the next generation of math3d, the current source code for which is at https://github.com/ChristopherChudzicki/math3d-react.

## Development

### Prerequisites

The math3d backend and database are managed by docker containers. The frontend is not currently containerized. You'll need:

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install), our JS package manager
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), for managing node versions
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), for containerization during development
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/index.html), a framework for running pre-commit hooks
- **Environment Variables**: Additionally, you'll want some way to load environment variables for the frontend, which currently runs on the host machine. We recommend using [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html), which a `.envrc` file along the lines of

  ```sh
  dotenv_if_exists .env.development # committed in repo
  dotenv_if_exists .env             # customizations
  ```
