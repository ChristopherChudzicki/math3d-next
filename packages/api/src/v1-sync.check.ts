// Compile-time sync check: the generated v1 client and the frontend
// source-of-truth math-item types must stay in sync. Drift fails `tsc`. This
// file is never imported or executed. (The shared eslint config ignores
// `_`-prefixed vars via varsIgnorePattern, so no eslint-disable is needed.)
//
// We assert an invariant `Equal` (each member structurally identical, not merely
// mutually assignable), via type-fest's `IsEqual` over `SimplifyDeep`-normalized
// types. The normalization is load-bearing: the generated types reach their
// members through indexed access into `components["schemas"][...]` and don't
// share the frontend types' concrete object representation, whereas the frontend
// type is a flat `{ id; type; properties }`. `IsEqual` compares type
// *representation*, not assignability, so it reports the two as different even
// though they describe the same values. `SimplifyDeep` resolves both sides into a
// single materialized object (recursively — the parametric/field members carry
// the mismatch nested inside `properties`, so shallow `Simplify` is not enough).
// After deep normalization both sides have identical representations and
// `IsEqual` matches them, deterministically across compiler runs and assertion
// orderings.
// `IsEqual` also distinguishes `any` from a concrete type, so if the generator
// ever collapsed `items`/`itemOrder` to `any` the assertion fails — no separate
// any-guard needed (unlike mutual assignability, which is any-blind).
//
// Phase A (#1144) made the `type` discriminant a string-literal union and Phase B
// made the item property types validate-free (the parse-time `validate` lives on
// `ValidatedParseable`, not the stored item), removing the real asymmetries — so
// no `Serialized<>` widening or `as`-cast crutches are needed.
//
// `type-fest` is pinned to an exact version: `SimplifyDeep`/`IsEqual` are deep
// recursive type machinery, and a bump can change how they reduce the generator's
// intersection union. After any type-fest bump, re-verify this still goes RED on a
// real drift (e.g. temporarily add a field to one side) before trusting green.
